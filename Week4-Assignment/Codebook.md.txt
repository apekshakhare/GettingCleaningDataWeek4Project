This script does the following 

PART-1 Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.


Here train_x, train_y are the training dataset objects
test_x,test_y are test dataset objects. They both are dataset and label set respectively.

subjects_train and subjects_test are subjects datasets

merged_x,merged_y,merged_s are merged training and test datasets



PART-2 Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

Object named features is the features dataset and to extract mean and standard deviation measurements we used a variable xtract and accodringly modified the main dataset into modified_x


PART-3 Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities 
 in the data set

activity_label object has the data from activity_labels.txt 
Used these to modify the activity labels in teh actual descriptive name


PART-4 Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive 
variable names.

We have features in features object and modified the labels in dataset based on the feature values


PART-5 From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Combine the dataset to have activity label and subject details as activity_bale and id respectively. Finally create a new dataset which has means of each measurement for each activity and each subject.
